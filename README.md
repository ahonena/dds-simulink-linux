# dds-simulink-linux
This repository holds information on how to make a preempt_rt Linux executable with Connext DDS components.

## Simulink target file for preempt_rt Linux
Download and install [this](https://github.com/CTU-IIG/ert_linux) Simulink Coder target.

## The CMakeLists.txt template
A simple template for a cmake project that takes links generated C-code to static RTI DDS Connext libraries

## Quick fixes of errors
The code generated by Simulink Coder will give some errors, at least with Matlab R2020a. The fix for this is just to run the _*add_legacy_macros*_ script.

Remember to add enough lockable memory in _/etc/security/limits.conf_.

Also use this command for adding privileges:;
_sudo setcap cap_sys_nice=ep my_executable_
